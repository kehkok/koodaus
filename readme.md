# Simple factorial Project 

This project demonstrates a simple factorial python code with documentation format

## Getting Started

There are three compute functions and a benchmark function with hard coded 
value.  There is a defined starting point, whereby is "if __name__ == '__main__':"
  

### Prerequisites

You require to have python development environment to execute the code. 

```
Either Python Version 2 or 3
```

## Executing 

You can run the python as following command

```
python t1_factorial.py
```

Alternative, you can execute in linux, as

```
chmod +x t1_factorial.py
./t1_factorial.py
```



### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
